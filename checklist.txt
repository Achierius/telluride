You appear to be advocating a new:
[ ] functional  [X] imperative  [ ] object-oriented  [X] procedural [ ] stack-based
[X] declarative [ ] "multi-paradigm"   [X] statically-typed  [ ] dynamically-typed
[ ] lazy  [ ] eager [ ] pure  [ ] impure  [ ] non-hygienic  [ ] visual
[X] beginner-friendly [X] non-programmer-friendly  [X] completely incomprehensible
programming language.  Your language will not work.  Here is why it will not work.

You appear to believe that:
[X] Syntax is what makes programming difficult
[ ] Garbage collection is free                [X] Computers have infinite memory
[ ] Nobody really needs:
    [X] concurrency  [X] a REPL  [X] debugger support  [X] IDE support  [ ] I/O
    [ ] to interact with code not written in your language
[X] The entire world speaks 7-bit ASCII
[ ] Scaling up to large software projects will be easy
[ ] Convincing programmers to adopt a new language will be easy
[ ] Convincing programmers to adopt a language-specific IDE will be easy
[X] Programmers love writing lots of boilerplate
[X] Specifying behaviors as "undefined" means that programmers won't rely on them
[X] "Spooky action at a distance" makes programming more fun

Unfortunately, your language has:
[ ] comprehensible syntax  [X] semicolons  [ ] significant whitespace  [X] macros
[ ] implicit type conversion  [ ] explicit casting  [X] type inference
[X] goto  [ ] exceptions  [X] closures  [ ] tail recursion  [ ] coroutines
[ ] reflection  [ ] subtyping  [ ] multiple inheritance  [ ] operator overloading
[ ] algebraic datatypes  [ ] recursive types  [ ] polymorphic types
[ ] covariant array typing  [ ] monads  [ ] dependent types
[ ] infix operators  [ ] nested comments  [ ] multi-line strings  [X] regexes
[ ] call-by-value  [ ] call-by-name  [ ] call-by-reference  [ ] call-cc

The following philosophical objections apply:
[ ] Programmers should not need to understand category theory to write "Hello, World!"
[X] Programmers should not develop RSI from writing "Hello, World!"
[ ] The most significant program written in your language is its own compiler
[X] The most significant program written in your language isn't even its own compiler
[X] No language spec
[X] "The implementation is the spec"
   [ ] The implementation is closed-source  [ ] covered by patents  [ ] not owned by you
[ ] Your type system is unsound  [ ] Your language cannot be unambiguously parsed
   [ ] a proof of same is attached
   [ ] invoking this proof crashes the compiler
[ ] The name of your language makes it impossible to find on Google
[ ] Interpreted languages will never be as fast as C
[X] Compiled languages will never be "extensible"
[ ] Writing a compiler that understands English is AI-complete
[ ] Your language relies on an optimization which has never been shown possible
[ ] There are less than 100 programmers on Earth smart enough to use your language
[ ] ______________________________________ takes exponential time
[X] ___the whole "turing machine" thing___ is known to be undecidable

Your implementation has the following flaws:
[ ] CPUs do not work that way
[X] RAM does not work that way
[ ] VMs do not work that way
[ ] Compilers do not work that way
[ ] Compilers cannot work that way
[ ] Shift-reduce conflicts in parsing seem to be resolved using rand()
[ ] You require the compiler to be present at runtime
[ ] You require the language runtime to be present at compile-time
[X] Your compiler errors are completely inscrutable
[X] Dangerous behavior is only a warning
[X] The compiler crashes if you look at it funny
[X] The VM crashes if you look at it funny
[X] You don't seem to understand basic optimization techniques
[X] You don't seem to understand basic systems programming
[X] You don't seem to understand pointers
[X] You don't seem to understand functions

Additionally, your marketing has the following problems:
[ ] Unsupported claims of increased productivity
[ ] Unsupported claims of greater "ease of use"
[X] Obviously rigged benchmarks
   [ ] Graphics, simulation, or crypto benchmarks where your code just calls
       handwritten assembly through your FFI
   [ ] String-processing benchmarks where you just call PCRE
   [ ] Matrix-math benchmarks where you just call BLAS
[ ] Noone really believes that your language is faster than:
    [ ] assembly  [ ] C  [ ] FORTRAN  [ ] Java  [ ] Ruby  [X] Prolog
[X] Rejection of orthodox programming-language theory without justification
[ ] Rejection of orthodox systems programming without justification
[X] Rejection of orthodox algorithmic theory without justification
[ ] Rejection of basic computer science without justification

Taking the wider ecosystem into account, I would like to note that:
[X] Your complex sample code would be one line in: ____ C ____
[ ] We already have an unsafe imperative language
[ ] We already have a safe imperative OO language
[ ] We already have a safe statically-typed eager functional language
[ ] You have reinvented Lisp but worse
[ ] You have reinvented Javascript but worse
[ ] You have reinvented Java but worse
[ ] You have reinvented C++ but worse
[ ] You have reinvented PHP but worse
[ ] You have reinvented PHP better, but that's still no justification
[X] You have reinvented Brainfuck but non-ironically

In conclusion, this is what I think of you:
[ ] You have some interesting ideas, but this won't fly.
[ ] This is a bad language, and you should feel bad for inventing it.
[X] Programming in this language is an adequate punishment for inventing it.
